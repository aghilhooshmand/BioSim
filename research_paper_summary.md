# BioSim: Semantic Feature Harmonization for Biological Datasets

## Abstract

We present BioSim, an intelligent feature harmonization system that addresses the computational challenge of comparing large-scale biological datasets. Traditional approaches require exhaustive pairwise comparisons between CLuB (Clinical and Laboratory Unified Biomarker) datasets (~400 features) and cBioPortal public data (~4000 features), resulting in 1.6 million potential comparisons. BioSim leverages BioBERT-based semantic similarity to efficiently identify meaningful feature matches, significantly reducing computational complexity while improving accuracy through domain-specific semantic understanding.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Biological data harmonization faces significant computational challenges when integrating diverse datasets. The CLuB project generates comprehensive biomarker data with approximately 400 clinical and laboratory features, while cBioPortal provides access to over 4000 standardized clinical features across multiple cancer studies. Traditional feature matching approaches require exhaustive pairwise comparisons (400 × 4000 = 1,600,000 pairs), which are computationally expensive and often produce low-quality matches due to lack of semantic understanding.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. Develop a semantic-based feature harmonization system using BioBERT technology
2. Reduce computational complexity from O(n²) to semantically meaningful comparisons
3. Improve matching accuracy through domain-specific language understanding
4. Provide an accessible web interface for researchers and clinicians

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

BioSim employs a modular architecture with five core components:

1. **Data Input Layer**: Handles CLuB and cBioPortal data ingestion
2. **Preprocessing Engine**: Validates, cleans, and normalizes input data
3. **BioBERT Model Integration**: Processes semantic embeddings using BioLORD-STAMB2-v1
4. **Similarity Calculation Engine**: Computes cosine similarity between feature representations
5. **Output Layer**: Generates harmonized results with visualization capabilities

### 2.2 BioBERT Model Selection

We selected BioLORD-STAMB2-v1 (FremyCompany/BioLORD-STAMB2-v1) as our base model due to its:
- Specialized training on biological and medical literature
- 768-dimensional embeddings optimized for biomedical text
- Proven performance in clinical text similarity tasks
- Support for medical terminology and abbreviations

### 2.3 Similarity Calculation Algorithm

The system implements the following similarity calculation pipeline:

```python
def sentence_similarity_by_torch_BioLORD(s1, s2, max_number_similarity):
    # 1. Tokenize sentences with BioBERT tokenizer
    encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')
    
    # 2. Generate embeddings with BioBERT model
    model_output = model(**encoded_input)
    
    # 3. Apply mean pooling with attention mask
    sentence_embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])
    
    # 4. Normalize embeddings
    sentence_embeddings = F.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)
    
    # 5. Calculate cosine similarity
    similarity = util.cos_sim(sentence_embeddings[0], sentence_embeddings[1])
    
    return similarity
```

### 2.4 Data Processing Workflow

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract feature names, descriptions, and default values
2. **Text Normalization**: Standardize medical terminology and abbreviations
3. **Embedding Generation**: Create semantic representations for each feature
4. **Similarity Computation**: Calculate pairwise cosine similarities
5. **Result Ranking**: Sort matches by similarity score
